                    Donut Panic! is an adventure, run-and-gun, shoot em up game with a nostalgic, absurd sense of humor and a retro 90s-inspired aesthetic.\
                    The game focuses on rescuing rather than just eliminating enemies.\
                    Players progress through first-person levels, fighting off foes and saving donuts before they get eaten.\
                      If all donuts are lost, the level is failed. Story\
                    Aliens have invaded Earth and are stealing all the donuts! Our hero, Donutello Crema (aka Donut Guy), has an obsessive love for donuts and won’t stand for this. Armed and determined, he’ll take on the alien menace to reclaim his beloved treats in this action-packed, comedy-filled adventure.",
